## Migrations

Current app implementation doesn't have a UI for adding new products, but you can run a script with migrations to add some products into the DB and receive it from the application's UI. Update this product information in the products-migration.js file in the migrations folder. Make sure MongoDB is installed and running first.

```sh
npm run migration:write
```
